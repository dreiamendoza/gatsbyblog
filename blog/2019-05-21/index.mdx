I have kept a note in my mind about the things that I wanted to improve. For the first 2 years of being in the industry, (also as a young developer) here are the things I have noticed about myself that will hinder me from achieving the best version of myself -- or maybe this could be you.

### 1. Overcoming Impostor Syndrome

When I started working in IT, the existing idea within my mind that programming is a male-dominated field came to life. I am not talking about a particular gender being better than the other at coding, but this creepling feeling of being a fraud never left me when stress is high at work. Deep down everyone knows the type of work that they like and enjoy. 

If you never heard of the word "Imposter Syndrome", it simply means that you thought you are not good enough at what you do. If you tend to identify yourself with the items listed below:

> 1. You call your successes as luck, or good timing.
> 2. When you encounter a problem/situation and feel like you don't have the abilities to figure things out.
> 3. Despite achieving many things, you feel that you don't deserve what you have or where you are right now.
> 4. You think that there will always be someone that deserves more of your current status or state in life or work.

The things mentioned above may make you sound humble, but in reality when you feel like people will take advantage of you because you feel and do those things above, I am afraid, my friend that we are all part of this thing called the Imposter Syndrome.
Read on many blogs and articles about this, and it tells you that a wide range of people feels this, from fresh-graduates to company CEOs. It is always important to get the equilibrium of things, to not be overconfident, and also to not treat yourself as a doormat to others. 

### 2. Positivity

Being optimistic is key. This word always has a philosophical meaning attached to it, and sometimes equated to being overconfident, or hopeful. 

To make things simple, when someone thinks everything is a glass half-filled, it activates a switch inside our minds to do things out of our comfort zone. This applies to learning some new Framework, or Programming Languages. Next thing to note while we engage in things outside of our comfort zone: failing is inevitable (like Thanos). And we may get discouraged if this happens. Being optimistic is not a one-time thing or a personality embedded to us (although some people are naturally optimistic) but I like to think of this as a habit, a habit for your mind.

Our minds are like stages of a theatre or musical. Every act is a thought. When a theatre act gives you negative feelings, you can control your mind to remove those actors and replace them with good thoughts.

### 3. Stop feeding and buying yourself nonessential things.

What are the things everyone loves to do to unwind? Oh I can say a loooooot about this. Some people (including me) kill myself slowly when being stressed such as buying high-sugared milk tea drink and greasy potato fries. Some binge on alcohol, do impulsive shopping, or impulsive outing (that is, going on expensive outing trips every weekend).

I won't judge other people but everyone of us should know better, and live less on what we earn. Some good things to do if we're stressed (not the things mentioned above):

> 1. Meditate or pray
> 2. Exercise or lose weight
> 3. Walk in the nature
> 4. Listen to calming music (even though I adored screamo, you may want peace sometimes)
> 5. Writing or blogging (like what I did)
> 6. Watch a funny movie
> 7. Bond with friends and family (but no alcohol or stress eating)
> 8. Sleep early / have enough sleep

Taking care of yourself is different than spoiling yourself. By spoiling yourself you may also mean that you are killing yourself. I am a labeled, certified milk tea addict and a fries lover. I also live a sedentary lifestyle, so if it means that changing your lifestyle meant caring for yourself, then do it. 

Aside from learning difficult technical topics at work, the things mentioned above are the recurring challenges I have faced in being an employee (2 years). Still in the process of overcoming the things above, I hope this will be remembered by readers.

Drei xoxo
