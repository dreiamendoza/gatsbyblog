Have you seen *Draw My Life* videos on Youtube? that would be like this blog post.

All my life I've been wanting to document my experiences about being a late bloomer.
Was it fun having people telling you that you could never become good at something?
Was it fun being alone all the time because people think you are weird? but in reality
you are just a socially awkward teen who uses plastic food containers as drums because you
are a frustrated multi-instrumentalist emo kid who wished to be in a metal band.

Forgive me because this will be a long post but I really needed to write this off my mind and feelings because
looking back I was never the little-miss-sunshine kid and teen that everyone loved. I come to terms with my past
and I recall everything was funny (now I am 22). As an adult I have more pressing things to worry about such as paying 
the bills and getting rid of too much body fat.

#### Chapter 1: *The snotty kid*

My mother told me recently that I was naturally an extrovert and loved meeting new people. 
When I was in Kindergarten, I was the one who initiated conversations with my classmates and teachers.
It started to change when I was being constantly bullied by the bigger kids (even immature teachers)
because I was very small and thin, with large inquisitive eyes. And also maybe I was a really weird kid (really true) -
I tried chewing Play-Doh and spit it out and teach my classmate how to bite her nails.

Academically I excelled at just one subject but have no failing ones throughout kindergarten and grade-school.
My subject of interest was English Language because I seem to get high to perfect marks at every test but for other subjects,
it was either failing or just had reached passing mark. The subject that I hated very much was Math. I learned the multiplication
table at age 10. As a young kid, I saw that schools in my country seem to treat the "smart ones" better than the less performing ones. I was a 3rd grader for goodness sake!
it was like experiencing Apartheid or the Caste-system. It was horrible to put this kind of pressure to kids who did not even
understand how the world works yet.

At this time I never understood the kids who are high achievers. I was a happy-go-lucky kid, and what are those
high achievers at this age up to? Do they do this just for the teacher to treat them better than us less performing kids?
Do their parents pressure them to be good at school?

The reason is,

I don't know really. Because all I care about was Cardcaptor Sakura acquiring another card for the day's episode.

#### Chapter 2: *Wearing my nihilist, satire, and cynic lenses*

I had to endure bullying until I reached high school. Kids and teachers really love to pick on me, I know.
As a tween who just got out of grade-school, I lost my love for meeting new people and initiating casual conversations.
I start to hide myself from people or even *avoid* meeting new people. Like Daria from MTV, I make people 
dislike me at first so when they do, it won't hurt me anymore.

This stage was like my emo-rebel stage. I was bored at school, bored at life in general and was oozing with angst.
I play computer games and listen to metal (I still do now today but at a healthy amount) slowly I forced myself to
like schooling and academics. What was it like to be respected and liked? in this society, people are liked or respected if they have 
achievements or lots of money. During my third year of high school, I
was transferred to the top section and also belonged to the "smartest" top 5 students. This time, I got the respect I wanted from
people. For the first time my self-esteem was back and I had confidence all for the pointless reason, to take revenge
to the people who mocked me - that I was an achiever student.

In college, I formed a true hunger for learning because of IT (but believe me I almost gave up when I started) while
being a scholar (never paid for tuition) and graduated with high honors. I still carried my selfish reason with me.
I wanted to smack the faces of the bullies and incompetent teachers in highschool with my gold and silver medals.
I am not saying being an achiever is bad, but it should never be your motivation to just prove your bullies wrong,
even when you get successful. What matters is what you have learned and what goes deep down in your heart. 

#### Chapter 3: *Successes and achievements are temporary*

The moment I worked in the industry, I found out that college honors are just necessary for your first job.
When I landed my second job my company never bothered to stress my scholarly achievements, but
my previous experiences. This reality did not hit me hard but I kept on thinking about it from some time ago.
Achievements just shows that you are good at studying and exams. I am not going into that
because that's not the take-away here (though I did work hard by studying to become one). I wanted
you to remember that successes and achievements are temporary. What's lasting is your legacy -- the knowledge you have
gathered and how you applied it in situations to make others happy. I am not talking about being helpful to feed your own ego,
but truly helping others because it puts a smile on their faces without asking anything in return.

This can be applied to any type of work you have whether you work at IT, Astronomy, or the Government. Personally, this is my biggest
struggle, because I have shut of myself from other people for so long that it formed a thick wall already. My plan to destroy this
wall is simple, to bring back the most innocent and free child-like mind that I have when I was a snotty kid. Go! talk to the
person getting his coffee at the pantry. Say a greeting to the cleaner who mopped the office floors.

In my career right now, I just landed on a new developer job in one of the country's biggest IT companies. I am
excited to take on things inside my circle of control with this new outlook in life. This will be more difficult
than before but I know in the end it will be worth it. I was not only a late-bloomer in academics, but also
a late-bloomer for a more meaningful purpose.

All the best,

Drei xoxo
