When I was in high school, I wanted to become a Psychologist or Psychiatrist. 
Little did I know when I reach adulthood I would become so unstable (just kidding).

Being in IT is never one of my plans, but thanks to my wonderful mom,
I landed on an industry where everyone's brain-power is exploited.
I get to create things just by typing some keys on a keyboard. Like some magician.

Being a junior developer (and reaching young-adulthood) here are some pointers that I can give:

##### 1. Job hunting

This is always not very easy for me, at least for most people. Preparing yourself talking to an interviewer is 
not that easy if you are a reserved and quiet person. But we absolutely know there's no other choice (tee-hee).

I also experienced some discrimination because I was a "female" developer. Surely that contributed a bit to my mild imposter syndrome, 
But slowly, thanks to my family and friends helping me to get back on track, and I know what I can do as a programmer.

Another thing to note is that almost all employers I have encountered (big or small) never really bothered
to probe about certifications. Employers care more about actual problem solving skills than certifications, which leads to my next pointer.

##### 2. Becoming a real developer

I have gathered things on what makes someone a real developer. 

> 1. Keeps a portfolio.
> 2. Has experience with building software projects outside your actual work.
> 3. Answers tech questions on forums.
> 4. Vows that you will be forever learning (and the rest of your life).

I would be glad if someone can add items to the list mentioned above. You can be a full-stack, front-end, or back-end developer. Starting in my career I enjoyed back-end development. If you want to do back-end development, you need to be very good at creating algorithms. I cannot say I am an expert in creating efficient algorithms but I do have my own style (which is visualizing the problem by writing on paper). Right now I am slowly transitioning to front-end development because I found out that I enjoy it more than the other. My ultimate dream is to become a full-stack developer.

To sum this point up, I want to say that do not ever get tired or feel intimidated to explore outside of your comfort zone, such as learning a new concept, language, framework, you name it.

##### 3. Taking things too seriously

Lastly, please don't forget to take care of yourself. It is already a given that being in IT is stressful,
and work will never stop until you reach 65. You will encounter setbacks and failures. If those moments come, always remember everyone has room for improvement. If you decide being a developer is not for you but still love working in IT, there are a lot of other types of IT work such as, Graphic Designing, SEO, QA, etc.

If you really love being a developer but the stress is quite too much, remember that failures are part of everyone's learnings and there is nothing to be ashamed of. Take a moment to look at the bigger picture, chill, have a vacation.
